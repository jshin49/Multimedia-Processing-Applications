<number of drums> <number of time slots>
<a sequence of 0 (off) and 1 (on)> <Drum instrument index>
<a sequence of 0 (off) and 1 (on)> <Drum instrument index>
....
<a sequence of 0 (off) and 1 (on)> <Drum instrument index>


Remark: For each of the 0 and 1 sequence, the 0s and 1s are separated by spaces, where the
number of 0s and 1s is equal to the number of time slots. Here is an example sequence:

0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 38

The number of time slots here equals to 10 and drum instrument 38 (Acoustic  snare) is using;
0 = off; 1 = on.
